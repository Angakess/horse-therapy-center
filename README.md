# Horse Therapy Center Management System

This project is a comprehensive software solution designed for a horse therapy center. It consists of two separate web applications tailored for different user roles and needs: one for employees and administrators, and another for clients and visitors.

## Project Overview
The system is divided into two main components:

### 1. **Administrative Platform** (Flask, Python)
This is a web application built using Flask, designed for employees and administrators to manage various aspects of the horse therapy center. Key features include:
- Employee management (adding, updating, and removing employees)
- Horse management (tracking horses and their status)
- Payment management (handling client payments and invoices)
- Client management (storing and managing client information)
- Statistical reports and analytics for administrators

### 2. **Client Platform** (Vue.js, JavaScript)
This is a user-facing web application built with Vue.js, allowing clients and visitors to interact with the organization. Key features include:
- Viewing news and updates related to the horse therapy center
- Contacting the organization through a contact form

## Technologies Used
- **Backend (Admin Panel):** Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, Marshmallow
- **Frontend (Admin Panel):** Bootstrap, Chart.js
